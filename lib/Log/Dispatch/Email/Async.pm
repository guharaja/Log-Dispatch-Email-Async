=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Introduction

This module is an extension for the Log::Dispatch::Email module.  It is an 
appender for Log::Log4perl.  It emails logged messages in seperate threads 
from the main one where logging occurs.  This enables the main thread to 
remain unblocked, while the emails are sent.  

A specified number of threads are started on creation of the module.  Emails 
are rapidly added to a queue in the main thread.  The multiple created 
threads race each other to empty the queue and email the content.  Each 
delivery may take upto several seconds but the main thread remains unblocked 
throughtout.  

At shutdown the module waits for a maximum specified timeout to allow the 
emails in queue to get sent.

=head2 Options

Perl threads are created with a seperate interpreter for each thread.  This 
is not the most most memory efficient.  Since the threads are created and 
remain in memory throughtout, unnecessarily large number of thread creation 
should be avoided.  

Depending on the number of threads and the anticipated volume of emails, an 
appropriate timeout should be set to allow for clearing any backlog, but also 
enabling the program to end if emails cannot be sent for some reason.

The stack size option is currently unused as its use appears to make the 
system unstable.

Options for other modules are documented in their own perldocs.  These modules 
are: Log::Dispatch::Email, Log::Dispatch::Output, Mail::Sender.

=head2 Daemons

Logging is an efficient way to display the state of long running daemons.  
Creating daemons involves forking two times to loose references of the 
starting shell.  Often it is required to initialize the logger before 
forking.  

Unfortunately, initialization of the mailing module does not survive this 
double forking.  The work arounds are: 1) initialize the logger after the 
forking is complete; and 2) initialize this appender in code as shown in 
the  SYNOPSIS.  (To preserve file and screen appenders across forkings, their 
file handles or descriptors also need to be preserved, somehow.)


=head1 METHODS

You will not be calling any of these methods explicitly.  The following is 
provided for help in understanding and in proper usage of this module.

=head2 new

Creates the object, the threads and the mailer.  It accepts and requires all 
options for Mail::Sender, Log::Dispatch::Email and Log::Dispatch::Output.  

This modules accepts these optional parameters: 

=head3 thread_count 

number of threads to create at the start; should be kept to a small number depending on email volume; default: 2 threads

=head3 timeout

seconds to waith for email backlog to clear on shutdown; must be kept large enough to clear anticipated backlog; default: 30 secs

=head3 stack_size

currently unused due to unstability; default: 16 kilobytes

=head3 debug_mode
   0 blocks all debug messaging; defaults is 0
   1 only print exit messages from DESTROY()
   2 also print detailed exist messages
   3 also print messages for object and threads creation 
   4 also print messages for enqueue, dequeue and emailing


=head2 send_email

Log::Dispatch::Email allows only a single string to be passed in.  If this
string contains double newlines, the string is split at these points.  Three 
parts are recognized - the subject line, receipients, and the message body.

If there is only a single split, the two field are assumed to be the Subject 
line and the message body; the reciepents in the mailer object set at creation
are used.

If there are no splits, the entire string string is used as the message body,
and a subject line is synthesised.

After determining the subject line, receipients, and the message body, 
they are simply added to the email queue for extraction and sending by the 
existing threads.


=head2 DESTROY

DESTROY is called for the main thread and once for each thread created.  If 
option debug_mode is set to a true value in the main routine, a line 
showing the emails handled by each thread is printed on STDERR.  The main 
thread (called object) shows the total number of emails queued.  This should 
equal the sum of the values in the threads.

=head1 TODOs

   DONE - create levels of debug messages for all methods; controlled by debug_mode
   - write tests
   - package and upload
